<h1>Getting the sample dashboards</h1>
<p>You can download sample Splunk and Elastic dashboards that present data forwarded by Workbench.</p>
<h2>Splunk dashboards</h2>
<p>The sample Splunk dashboards are available in a Splunk app. You can get the app in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>From <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/fundisoftware/taw-splunk">Docker Hub</a>,
in a Docker image that contains an installation of Splunk configured with the app and sample data.
<p>This option is useful for demonstrating the dashboards.
You can start a Docker container, and then immediately use the dashboards with the supplied sample data, with no configuration required.</p></li>
<li>From <a href="https://github.com/fundisoftware/taw-splunk">GitHub</a>, as an app directory that you can add to your own Splunk installation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Elastic dashboards</h2>
<p>The sample Elastic (Kibana) dashboards are available from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/fundisoftware/taw-elastic">Docker Hub</a>
in a Docker image that contains an installation of the Elastic Stack configured with the dashboards and sample data.</p>
