<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/marketplace/transaction-analysis-workbench-for-z">IBM Transaction Analysis Workbench for z/OS</a> (colloquially known as Workbench or TAW) is an operations analytics tool that
can forward many types of z/OS-based logs to analytics platforms such as Splunk and Elastic.</p>
<p>You can <a href="get-dashboards.html" class="toc">get sample Splunk and Elastic dashboards</a> that present log data forwarded by Workbench.</p>
<p>This documentation presents JCL for using Workbench to forward your own log data to those sample dashboards.</p>
<p>In particular, this documentation describes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log record types required by each dashboard</li>
<li>Fields that the dashboards require from those record types</li>
</ul>
<p>For an introduction to the sample dashboards, watch this video:</p>

<p>The video states that the fields in the JCL generated by the Workbench ISPF dialog match the fields required by the sample dashboards.
However, as of February 2018, that statement is not true. The fields in the JCL generated by the dialog are intended only as a starting point
for operations analytics; they do not match the specific fields required by the sample dashboards.
To forward your own logs to the sample dashboards, specify the fields in the JCL presented in this documentation.</p>
